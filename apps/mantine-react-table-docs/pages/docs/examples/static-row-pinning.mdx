## Static Row Pinning Example

Mantine React Table has the ability to pin rows and keep them in view while scrolling. In this example, when rows are pinned, they will be pinned statically to either the top or bottom of the table. Learn more about row pinning in the [Row Pinning Feature Guide](/docs/guides/row-pinning).
